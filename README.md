Now UI Kit React is a free Bootstrap 4, React, React Hooks and Reactstrap UI Kit provided for free by Invision and Creative Tim. It is a beautiful cross-platform UI kit featuring over 50 elements and 3 templates.

Now UI Kit is one of the most popular UI Kits online, provided in PSD and Sketch formats by Invision. We wanted to find a way for developers worldwide to benefit from using it. So, in collaboration with Invision, we are launching the React version for it!

Create awesome, lifelike prototypes with InVision and Now so your users can experience and give feedback on your vision!

To get the PSD and Sketch files, please visit [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/design-resources/now/?ref=creativetim). We used 100 Icons from our friends from Nucleo Icons, check their [12.000 icons here](https://nucleoapp.com/?ref=1712).
